Q.1  What do you understand By Database
=>   A database is a collection of organized data that's stored eletronically and can be accessed, managed, and updated.

Q.2  What is Normalization?
=> Normalization is about organizing data in a database to make it efficient and reliable. By breaking data into related tables and following specific rules, you can reduce duplication and keep your data clean and easy to manage!

Why Normalize?
-> Reduce Redundancy: Avoid storing the same information in multiple places.
-> Improve Data Integrity: Changes in one place automatically reflect where needed, minimizing errors.
-> Simplify Queries: Makes it easier to retrieve and manipulate data.

Q.3 What is Difference between DBMS and RDBMS?

=>             DBMS                                                        
1. DBMS stores data as file.	                           
2. Data elements need to access individually.           
3. No relationship between data.                        

4. Normalization is not present.	                       
5. DBMS does not support distributed database.	        
6. Data redundancy is common in this model.	           
7. Security is less                                     
8. It supports single user.	                          
9. Data fetching is slower for the large                
   amount of data.                                      
10. Low software and hardware necessities.	           
11. Examples: XML, Window Registry, Forxpro,            
    dbaseIIIplus etc.

=>           RDBMS
1. RDBMS stores data in tabular form.
2. Multiple data elements can be accessed at the same time.
3. Data is stored in the form of tables which are relate to each other.
4. Normalization is present.
5. RDBMS supports distributed database.
6. Keys and indexes do not allow Data redundancy.
7. More security measures provided.
8. It supports multiple users.
9. Data fetching is fast because of relational approach.
10. Higher software and hardware necessities.
11. Examples: MySQL,PostgreSQL,SQL Server,Oracle,Microsoft  Access etc.


Q.4 What is MF Cod Rule of RDBMS Systems?
=> E.F codd was a computer scientits who invented the relational nodel for database management.
   based on relational model, the relational database was created. codd proposed 13 rules popdlarly known as codd's 12 rules to test DBMS's concept against his relational nodel.

Q.5 What do you understand By Data Redundancy?
=>  data redundancy occurs when the same data is stored in multiple places.

Q.6 What is DDL Interpreter?
=>  it interpreter the DDL (Data definition language) instructions and stores the record in a data dictionary. cin a table containing meta-data.

Q.7 What is DML Compiler in SQL?
=>  A data manipulation language DML is a computer programming language used for adding (inserting), deleting, and modifying (updating) data in a database. A DML is often a sublanguage of a broader database language such as SQL, with the DML comprising some of the operators in the language.

Q.8 What is SQL Key Constraints writing an Example of SQL Key Constraints.
=> Key constraints in SQL are rules that ensure the integrity and uniqueness of data in a database. They help maintain organized and reliable data by preventing duplicates and ensuring relationships between tables.

Types of Key Constraints:

-> Primary Key: This uniquely identifies each record in a table. No two rows can have the same primary key  value, and it cannot be null.
-> Foreign Key: This creates a link between two tables. It ensures that a value in one table matches a value in another tableâ€™s primary key, maintaining referential integrity.
-> Unique Key: This ensures that all values in a column (or a combination of columns) are unique, but unlike primary keys, it can accept null values.

Example:
create table students (student_id int primary key, name varchar(100), email varchar(100));
create table courses (course_id int primary key, course_name varchar(100), student_id int, foreign key (student_id) references students(student_id));

Q.9 What is save Point? How to create a save Point write a Query?
=>  A savepoint is a named entity that represents the state of data and schemas at a particular point within a unit of work. You can create savepoints within a transaction. If the transaction rolls back, changes are undone to the specified savepoint, rather than to the beginning of the transaction.

Q.10 What is trigger and how to create a Trigger in SQL?
=>  A database trigger is a PL/SQL block stored in a database and executed implicitly whenever a triggering event like insert,update delete occurrs.
-> A trigger cannot be called or executed , the DBMS autmatically fires the trigger as a result of data modification to the table.
-> Each trigger is attached to a single specific table in the database.

Syntax To Create a Trigger :

 CREATER TRIGGER <t_name>
 {Before/After}
 {Insert/update /Delete} on <table_name>
 [For each row]
 Declare
        Declaration section
 Begin
        Executable section
 Exception
         Exception section
 End;
