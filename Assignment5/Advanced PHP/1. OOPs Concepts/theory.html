    <h2>Ans1. Define Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and its four main principles: Encapsulation,
        Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.</h2>

    <h2>1. Encapsulation: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> the attributes of an entity are enclosed in itself. In other words, encapsulation
            is when an object (inside a class) keeps its state private and<br> only exposes the selected information.
            This principle requires the ability to define some fields as either private or public</li>

        <h2>2. Abstraction</h2>
        <h2>3. Inheritance: </h2>
        <li> A class properties used by another class there we used inheritance
            <br>or<br>
            A class properties access by its another class i.e called inheritance<br>
            Note : inheritance is used by extends keyword

            <h3> types of inheritance </h3>
        <li>1) single inheritance</li>
        <li>2) multilevel inheritance </li>
        <li>3) multiple inheritance </li>

        <h2>4. Polymorphism:</h2>

    </ul>

Abstraction: hide important information in order to reduce complexity. It is when the user only
interacts with specific object's methods and/or attributes. By hiding complex details from the user,
abstraction consequently reduces complexity.
‍
Inheritance: as the name indicates, an entity can inherit attributes from other entities.
More precisely, parent classes can extend their attributes and behaviors to child classes,
which also means that this principle supports reusability.
‍
Polymorphism: entities can have more than one form. Hence the poly. In sum, polymorphism is when objects
are designed to share behaviors. By overriding or overloading, the same method can perform different behaviours.

File handling in PHP refers to the various functions and methods available in the language that enable developers to 
read, write, manipulate, and manage files and directories on a server or local machine. PHP provides 
several built-in functions like open (), fwrite(),
 fread(), fclose(), and others to manipulate files in different modes like read, write, append, binary, etc.
