    <h2>Ans5. Discuss method overloading and how it is implemented in PHP. </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Method Overloading: It is a type of overloading for creating dynamic methods that are not declared within
            <br> the class scope. PHP method overloading also triggers magic methods dedicated to the appropriate
            purpose.
            <br> Unlike property overloading, PHP method overloading allows function call on both object and static
            context.
