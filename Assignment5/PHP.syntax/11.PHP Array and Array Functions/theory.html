    <h2>Ans11.Define arrays in PHP. What are the different types of arrays?</h2>
    <h4>In PHP, there are three types of arrays.</h4>
    <li>Indexed Array: These are the arrays with a numeric index. </li>
    <li>Associative Array: These are the arrays with named keys.</li>
    <li>Multidimensional Array: These arrays contain one or more arrays within themselves.</li>

    <h4> Indexed arrays:</h4>
    <li>These are the most common and regular array types used in PHP, <br>
        where the values have numeric indexes by which they can be referenced.</li>

    <h4>Associative Array:</h4>
    <li> With these arrays, the stored values are given name keys to serve as an <br>
        index instead of the numeric index. They are mainly used when fetching named columns <br>
        of a database table.</li>

    <h4>Multidimensional arrays:</h4>
    <li>These types of arrays are usually known as arrays of arrays (2d) or arrays of arrays of arrays<br>
        (3d), and so on. They are simply arrays that contain other arrays. </li>
