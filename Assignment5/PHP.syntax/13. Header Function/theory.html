    <h2>What is the header function in PHP and how is it used ?</h2>
    <li>The header() function in PHP sends a raw HTTP header to a client or browser. Before HTML, XML, JSON,
        <br> or other output is given to a browser or client, the server sends raw data as header information with the
        <br> request (particularly HTTP Request).
    </li>
    <li>header() function in PHP is used to send raw HTTP header and it must be called before any output is sent to the
        requester, either by <br>normal HTML tags, blank lines in a file, or from PHP.
    </li>
