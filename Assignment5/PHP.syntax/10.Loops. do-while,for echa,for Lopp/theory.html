    <h2>Ans.10 Discuss the difference between for loop, foreach loop, and do-while loop in PHP.</h2>
    <ul>
        <h4>for loop</h4>
        <li>The iteration is clearly visible. The block of code is repeated as long as
            the condition is met or the counter meets a specific value.</li>
        <li> Good performance.</li>
        <li>The stop condition is specified easily.</li>
        <li> upon working with collections, it needs the usage of the count() function.</li>


        <h4>foreach loop</h4>
        <li>The iteration is hidden. The block of code is repeated until iterating over the array is completed.</li>
        <li> Better performance.</li>
        <li>The stop condition has to be explicitly specified.</li>
        <li> it can simply work without the usage of the count() method. </li>

        <h4>do-while loop</h4>
        <li>In a while loop, the condition is checked before the loop body executes. So the body may not <br>
            execute even once if the condition is false from the beginning. On the other hand,<br>
            in a do while loop the body is guaranteed to execute at least once because the<br>
            condition is checked after executing the body.</li>
    </ul>
